# Project-Physics
Don't expect regular updates on the software (I mean, at least whenever there is a software to be updated lol.)

This project is supposed to be a multi-year project, since I have to study physics first, to then be
able to generate a proper functioning software that works as intended.

# Focus:
------
The focus of this project is to generate a software that allows students to test their physics problems, 
helping them visualize any theoretical problem that they can not see in a lab.

# Motivation:
-----------
The motivation for this problem is the fact that there are a lot of numerous classes throughout all
universities, which means many students are not able to properly test their physics problems,
in some cases making them unable to solve them.

# Functionalities:
----------------

General conditions:
Given the parameters provided by the student, the software should be able to generate a visual
representation of the problem. There must be limits to how wrong the parameters may be to avoid
any incorrect representation, or overload of systems due to a higher order parameter read.

1.- The software should have different sections, for different types of physics problems.
	e.g.
		-Mechanics
			-Solid bodies.
			-Fluids.
			-Quantum Mechanincs
		-Thermodynamics
			-Ideal Gases.
			-Thermodynamic laws.
		-Electromagnetism
			-Faraday law
			-etc.

2.- There has to be theoretical explanations for every sub-topic within every topic, followed by
instructions on how the parameters of each situation will work, making sure there are no possible
confusions on the user's side.

3.- Teachers, physicists and students should be allowed to upload comments to the system that will
directly come to me for any recommendations or errors within the system.
